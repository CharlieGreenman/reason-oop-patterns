"This pattern appears as a central concept in MLâ€™s module system. Modules act
as global singletons that can provide all kinds of functionality. Functor
instantiation is another good example how singletons appear in ML." - Taken from http://people.csail.mit.edu/dnj/teaching/6898/projects/vicente-wagner.pdf

I wanted to stay true to how modules act as a global singleton, so I have
modules to signify singletons in Reason/OCaml.
